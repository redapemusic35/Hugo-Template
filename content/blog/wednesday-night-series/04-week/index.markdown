subtitle: ""
excerpt: "Humility manifests itself in our relationships---to God, to ourselves, to others. We are to be humble toward God and His word, humble in regard to trials and blessings that come our way, or abilities and achievements with which we are blessed, and humble toward other people. Humility is the proper attitude with which to approach all these relationships and circumstances. Like love, it defies adequate definition; it can be described and understood only as it is applied to everyday living. (Practices of Godliness, 69)"

# Day 1

Humility, is central to relationship. To God, to ourselves, to others. Humility towards God and others, is exercised through our trials, blessings, abilities, and achievements. We approach our relationships via humility. In other words, humility is undefinable, described and understood only by our lives. (Loosely paraphrased from page 69.)

# Chapter Outline

God commends the humble person.^[See Isaiah 57:15; and 66:1--2] God esteems those who are humble, promising to dwell with them, bestowing grace to them and exalting them.^[Also see James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:6; Luke 18:14] Also humility opens the way for the other virtues, assuming these are relational, it the way in which we cultivate our relationships with God, ourselves and others.

## Humility Before God

Humility begins with the fear of God and characterizes every aspect of every relationship we have with others. 

1. In healthy relationships with others, we humbly receive the blessings of such relationships as coming from God.
2. In unhealthy relationships, we "are to humbly accept them as from an infinitely wise and living heavenly Father."

I have no qualms with 1, but 2 seems strange. For instance, is there an extent to where we accept these as coming from the Father. Possibly, what is not mentioned are those unhealthy relationships Israel had with its neighbors. Often these were approached from the position of a recognition of sin on Israel's part, meaning that Israel often viewed these unhealthy relationships as a correction, or opportunity for growth given some past sin.

For instance, see David's Prayer in Psalm 5:

> Listen to my words, O Lord Consider my groaning and sighing.
>
> Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, For to You I pray.
>
> In the morning, O Lord, You will hear my voice;
>
> In the morning I will prepare [a prayer and a sacrifice] for You and watch and wait [for You to speak to my heart].
>
> For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil [person] dwells with You.
>
> The boastful and the arrogant will not stand in Your sight;
You hate all who do evil.
>
> You destroy those who tell lies;
The Lord detests and rejects the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
>
> But as for me, I will enter Your house through the abundance of Your steadfast love and tender mercy;
>
> At Your holy temple I will bow [obediently] in reverence for You.
>
> O Lord, lead me in Your righteousness because of my enemies; Make Your way straight (direct, right) before me.
>
> For there is nothing trustworthy or reliable or truthful in what they say; Their heart is destruction [just a treacherous chasm, a yawning gulf of lies].
>
> Their throat is an open grave;
>
> They [glibly] flatter with their [silken] tongue.
>
> Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own designs and councils!
>
> Cast them out because of the abundance of their transgressions, For they are mutinous and have rebelled against You.
>
> But let all who take refuge and put their trust in You rejoice, Let them ever sing for joy; Because You cover and shelter them,
>
> Let those who love Your name be joyful and exult in You.
>
> For You, O Lord, bless the righteous man [the one who is in right standing with You];
>
> You surround him with favor as with a shield.

Is this how we should view our own unhealthy relationships with our neighbors? What is interesting about such an approach, is that the neighbors in such cases were not often considered moral agents in the same sense as the Israelites. While they might have been agents of God's wrath, assuming that Israel repented of its various sins, God then would give the Israelites victory over the neighbor. 

### Some More Examples


Is this what we should pray for concerning our own unhealthy relationships? That God give us victory over our neighbors? I don't think so, unless victory means the neighbor coming to full knowledge and recognition of God's goodness, and into a relationship with Him. So the way in which the analogy would hold given the redeeming work of Christ, is that Israel's neighbors rather than being destroyed, would instead be redeemed by the awe inspiring redemption of Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

# Day 2

The following is a summary of examples of Humility as expressed by Jesus:

Matt 11:28--30. Not sure what the example of humility as it is shown here. Here are some attempts: 

* Jesus invites others to lay their burdens on him. "Come to me all of you who are weary . . ." etc. Maybe from anyone else this would be ambitious? Knowing that your friend is experiencing a period of hardship, you say to them: if you need to talk, you know where I live. But then maybe this is saying something more, as in "come on, I know a great place where we can go to talk, I promise you'll feel better."

Matt 20:28. "That's the way it is with the son of man, he did not come to be served but to serve."

* This is undoubtedly a possible example of humility on the assumption that it is sincere. I think that it is safe to say that this is sincere since before it, Jesus is calling on His disciples to follow the example which he has just set continually before this. He is admonishing the disciples who had been fighting over who would have the highest position of honor in the world to come.

Luke 2:7; 2:51. verse 7 recounts Jesus's birth in a manger while 51 tells anecdotally of Jesus's obedience to his parents. 

John 13:1--5. It seems that here, there is an instance wherein Jesus's actions upon his knowledge of Judas' betrayal can be contrasted against say a death row inmate, or political prisoner. For instance, Socrates famously was forced to drink Hemlock. His final actions consisted of acceptance, and a final act to pontificate among his followers in dramatic fashion. A death row inmate might order hundreds of dollars worth of food, in the end refusing to even take a bite of it. A political prisoner might make one last appeal, or making a series of statements intended to convince the world of his moral superiority. However, Jesus rather than waxing poetic in the hour of his impeding death, choose instead to personally show what humility looked like.
