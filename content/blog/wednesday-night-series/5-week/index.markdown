Concerning contentment, it is the traits of focusing our hearts on God rather than on possessions, position, or power.

> The truly godly person is not interested in becoming rich. He possesses inner resources which furnish riches far beyond that which earth can offer. (William Hendriksen, quoted on page 81)

Contentment means expressing sufficiency with God’s promise for provision (our needs) and God’s grace for our circumstances. While we might think that contentment refers only to wealth and professions, there are other areas of life where we need to learn contentment. Although Bridges does not mention these, some that initially came to my mind were: acceptance; for instance by our community members, neighbors, political and social leaders, law enforcement, educational institutions to name a few. 

The desire for acceptance is similar to the desire to be liked, or more importantly, loved. Some other areas however include: security, safety, family, meaningful friendships, deep and interpersonal relationships. We do not often talk about these needs, but they are just as important it would seem. 

While the bible does say that money is the root of all evil, it is not clear what the relationship is between the desire for money, and these other desires. Either way, I think what should be focused on, is that God’s promise for provision does not only apply to wealth and profession, position, but also these other areas as well. When we truly live in relationship with God, he meets these other needs also. 

Some bible verses: 

* 2 Timothy 4:16; At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. Vs. 17; but the Lord stood by me.

• 2 Timothy 1:15; You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.

• Luke 23:34

• Mark 8:31; And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again.
• Luke 9:22
• Luke 18:31—34; . . . For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. . . .

## Contentment with Possessions

Regarding a general prohibition against covetousness, Bridges argues that these can lead to murder, theft, and adultery. See Exodus 20:13—17. Further, these acts appear to represent a kind of worship. I am not quite sure how to tie murder, theft and adultery with worship, but it may have something to do with how prior cultures practiced their own religions, sacrificing their children to Molech for instance.
